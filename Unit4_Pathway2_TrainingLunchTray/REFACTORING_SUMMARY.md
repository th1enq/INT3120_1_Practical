  - Used constants instead of hardcoded values
  - Added comprehensive documentation
  - Improved method naming and structure
  - Better separation of concerns

### 4. **Navigation and Screen Management**

  - Separated concerns into smaller, focused functions
  - Created dedicated `LunchTrayAppBar` and `LunchTrayNavigation` composables
  - Extracted order handling logic into helper functions
  - Improved code organization and readability
  - Better separation of UI concerns

### 5. **UI Component Refactoring**

  - Broke down monolithic composable into smaller, focused components
  - Added semantic roles for accessibility
  - Improved styling and visual hierarchy
  - Better separation of concerns
  - Enhanced reusability

- **Enhanced**: All Menu Screens (`EntreeMenuScreen.kt`, `SideDishMenuScreen.kt`, `AccompanimentMenuScreen.kt`)
  - Added comprehensive documentation
  - Improved type safety in selection handlers
  - Standardized preview composables
  - Better code consistency

- **Enhanced**: `ui/StartOrderScreen.kt`
  - Separated welcome message and button into distinct composables
  - Added better typography and styling
  - Improved visual hierarchy
  - Used constants for UI values

- **Enhanced**: `ui/CheckoutScreen.kt`
  - Complete restructure into focused, single-responsibility components
  - Improved data presentation with better formatting
  - Enhanced visual hierarchy and styling
  - Better separation of order summary, calculations, and actions

### 6. **Data Source Improvements**
- **Enhanced**: `datasource/Datasource.kt`
  - Added comprehensive documentation
  - Included helper methods for menu analysis
  - Added utility functions for price range calculation
  - Better code organization and comments

### 7. **Validation and Error Handling**
- **New File**: `util/ValidationUtils.kt`
  - Comprehensive validation utilities for menu items and orders
  - Price validation with reasonable limits
  - Input validation for names and descriptions
  - Order completeness validation

## Architecture Improvements

### Separation of Concerns
- Each composable now has a single, clear responsibility
- Business logic separated from UI logic
- Navigation logic centralized and organized

### Code Reusability
- Base components that can be extended and customized
- Utility functions for common operations
- Consistent patterns across similar components

### Maintainability
- Constants centralized for easy configuration changes
- Clear documentation throughout the codebase
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper error handling and validation

### Accessibility
- Added semantic roles for better screen reader support
- Improved focus management
- Better visual hierarchy

### Type Safety
- Improved type checking in selection handlers
- Better null safety practices
- More explicit type declarations

## Best Practices Implemented

### Kotlin Best Practices
- Used data classes appropriately
- Leveraged sealed classes for type safety
- Proper use of extension functions
- Immutable data structures where appropriate

### Compose Best Practices
- Single responsibility principle for composables
- Proper state management
- Consistent modifier usage
- Preview composables for all screens

### Android Architecture Best Practices
- MVVM pattern properly implemented
- Unidirectional data flow
- Proper lifecycle management
- State hoisting where appropriate

## Code Quality Improvements

### Documentation
- Added KDoc comments for all public functions and classes
- Explained complex business logic
- Provided usage examples in comments

### Naming
- More descriptive function and variable names
- Consistent naming conventions throughout
- Clear intent expressed through naming

### Error Handling
- Input validation at appropriate layers
- Graceful handling of edge cases
- Proper null safety practices

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Code is now easier to modify and extend
2. **Better Testability**: Smaller, focused functions are easier to test
3. **Enhanced Readability**: Clear structure and documentation make the code self-documenting
4. **Increased Reusability**: Components can be more easily reused and extended
5. **Better Performance**: More efficient rendering through better component structure
6. **Improved Accessibility**: Better support for users with disabilities
7. **Type Safety**: Reduced runtime errors through better type checking
8. **Consistency**: Uniform patterns and practices throughout the codebase

## Future Enhancements

The refactored code provides a solid foundation for future improvements:
- Easy addition of new menu categories
- Simple integration of data persistence
- Straightforward addition of user preferences
- Easy implementation of order history
- Simple addition of payment processing
- Straightforward internationalization support

This refactoring establishes a robust, maintainable, and extensible codebase that follows Android and Compose best practices while providing a solid foundation for future development.
